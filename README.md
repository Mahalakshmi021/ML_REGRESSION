# ML_REGRESSION

California Housing Regression Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of various regression algorithms for the California Housing dataset, as part of a supervised learning assignment.

Dataset

The California Housing dataset is used in this assignment, which contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices.

Implemented Regression Algorithms

The following regression algorithms are implemented in this repository:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. R-squared Score (RÂ²)

Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files:

- california_housing_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of regression algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- README.md: This file.

Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn library
- pandas library
- numpy library

Usage
